# Sentiment_Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis application that uses the OpenAI GPT model to classify text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The application analyzes user-provided text and stores the results (including the input text, sentiment classification, and timestamp) into an SQLite database.
